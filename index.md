# The most important Australian seats in 2025
# (and how you can help keep Dutton out)

## Overview
To win the 2025 Australian federal election, Dutton needs to net 11 seats from the ALP to bring his party to the most seats. He may then attempt to form a minority government with crossbenchers, such as the Teals. Dutton has 15 vulnerable ALP seats and 6 vulnerable crossbench seats up for grabs, but there are also 26 equally vulnerable LNP seats.

According to a traditional Pendulum model (using margins from the last election and the change in the 2-party-preferred polls since then), Dutton would need a swing of 3.6% to win 11 ALP seats. This would be the largest swing towards the LNP since Abbott ousted Rudd/Gillard following the 2013 spills. As of four months before election day, Dutton is polling at a 2.6% swing. Historically, polls tend to narrow as election day approaches, but could the polls be underestimating the LNP, as they did in 2019? It's possible, but Dutton would need support similar to Abbott's in 2013. Alternatively, the polls could be off due to normal sampling error, and there’s a 9.3% chance he could have the 3.6% swing he needs (for the stats nerds: I'm just using simple standard deviations here).

A more likely path to victory for Dutton would be if he wins back more crossbench seats than he loses. If he can capture even 3 of the 6 vulnerable crossbench seats (without losing any of his 26 vulnerable LNP seats), Dutton could secure the plurality  with a 2.8% swing. This could happen if the polls are slightly underestimating him.

In summary: Will Peter Dutton *definitely* win the 2025 election? No! He faces significant challenges, including many vulnerable seats and fresh competition from the Teals. However, can he win? Yes—if he can regain some of the seats the LNP lost to the Teals and Greens in 2022, and net a few more seats than his current polling suggests, he could form a minority government. A polling miss similar to 2019 (if his actual swing were 6.1%, the largest since Howard lost to Rudd in 2007) would put him in a position to achieve a majority.

The key questions are: Will the Teals continue to gain ground, or will they recede? And is Dutton gaining the same kind of momentum in his favor as Abbott did against Rudd/Gillard in 2013? If both of these concerns go against Dutton, he will not win. 

Ahead, let's look at the key seats that will decide the 2025 election, and see what you can do to get involved.

However, a construction timeline has yet to be confirmed, prompting calls for expedited action. (Daily Telegraph, 2025)

The Division of Lingiari is an Australian electoral division in the Northern Territory, encompassing the entire territory outside of Darwin, including remote Indigenous communities and the territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

- **Alice Springs**: In the lead-up to the 2025 federal election, the Country Liberal Party (CLP) has pre-selected Territory-born federal police officer Lisa Siebert to contest the federal seat of Lingiari against Labor's Marion Scrymgour. Siebert, who grew up in Gunbalanya and Darwin, emphasizes fair representation for the Territory, economic growth, national security, law and order, and free speech. The CLP believes Siebert's deep roots and dedication make her a passionate and effective advocate, capable of bringing real progress to the Territory. Additionally, the Nationals have pledged to support breakaway land councils in the Northern Territory if elected, aiming to decentralize the current bodies managing Aboriginal land and royalties. National Party leader David Littleproud emphasized the need for localized empowerment and bespoke local solutions, diverging from the generalizing tendencies of larger representative bodies. This approach aligns with their opposition to the Voice referendum, which they argue favored Canberra bureaucracy. Current laws would need amendments for the Commonwealth to break up the NT land councils, so the party plans to back traditional owners who wish to form separate councils. Additionally, NT Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, assigned to a new 'government efficiency' platform, confirmed an inquiry into land councils' statutory authorities to address issues like royalty payments and their impacts on communities.

The Division of Blair is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland, encompassing parts of the Brisbane City Council, Ipswich City Council, Scenic Rim Regional Council, and Somerset Regional Council. Established in 1998, it is named in honor of Harold Blair, a noted tenor and Aboriginal activist.

- **Ipswich**: In the recent Queensland election, Labor experienced a significant vote collapse in outer Brisbane seats, which has given the Coalition hope of making gains in suburban areas nationwide in the next federal election. The Liberal National Party's historic victory underscores the importance of addressing economic policies for voters struggling with rising living costs. Outgoing Labor Premier Steven Miles faced criticism for not conceding promptly on election night. Labor's primary vote fell by nearly 7%, with inner-city areas performing better than outer suburbs. Pollster Kos Samaras noted a trend of declining Labor support in outer suburbs across multiple states, posing challenges for both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton. While Labor faces difficulties in traditionally safe suburban areas, a drop in Green support in inner-city seats offers potential gains. Albanese plans to emphasize Labor's commitment to workers' rights and higher wages during his Brisbane visit.

The suburb of Liverpool is divided between the federal divisions of Hughes and Werriwa, with the southern part falling under Werriwa, represented by Labor's Anne Stanley.
